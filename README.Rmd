# ABOUT:

The Duke FinTech Trading Competition is a 3-month long event in which student
traders from around the world create paper trading accounts at Interactive 
Brokers and trade anything they want, including stocks, bonds, options, futures,
currencies, crypto, and [any of the other products offered by Interactive 
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/products-invest-prod.php).

Due to the way in which we score & rank our participants, if you do well in this competition, it's because you're a good trader. Furthermore, we've introduced a
*bracket* system this year to keep ALL of our traders interested and engaged. In
the new system, even if you don't stand much chance of taking the #1 spot
overall, you can still compete for a top rank *within your bracket*, giving you
a hard-earned accomplishment that you can report on your resume or CV.

To see how we accompilsh all this -- and what makes us special -- check out our [scoring philosophy](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Scoring.html). Then you can begin the [sign up](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/sign_up.html) process!

As a participating trader in this competition you will:

- Download Trader Workstation (Interactive Brokers' professional-grade trading
platform) and use it to trade real assets with real market prices using 
simulated money
- Join the Gothic Hedge Hub (our companion Discord Server) which you can use 
to communicate with other traders, the Competition admins, and industry 
sponsors
- Gain a chance to show recruiters and the world your trading skills

Go ahead and join now! We'll look forward to seeing you in the Discord server :)
