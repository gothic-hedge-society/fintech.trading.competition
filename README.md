# ABOUT:

The Duke FinTech Trading Competition is a 3-month long event in which
student traders from around the world create paper trading accounts at
Interactive Brokers and trade anything they want, including stocks,
bonds, options, futures, currencies, crypto, and [any of the other
products offered by Interactive
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/products-invest-prod.php).

Due to the way in which we score & rank our participants, if you do well
in this competition, it’s because you’re a good trader. Furthermore,
we’ve introduced a *bracket* system this year to keep ALL of our traders
interested and engaged. In the new system, even if you don’t stand much
chance of taking the \#1 spot overall, you can still compete for a top
rank *within your bracket*, giving you a hard-earned accomplishment that
you can report on your resume or CV.

To see how we accompilsh all this – and what makes us special – check
out our [scoring
philosophy](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Scoring.html).
Then you can begin the [sign
up](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/sign_up.html)
process!

As a participating trader in this competition you will:

- Download Trader Workstation (Interactive Brokers’ professional-grade
  trading platform) and use it to trade real assets with real market
  prices using simulated money
  - Join the Gothic Hedge Hub (our companion Discord Server) which you
    can use to communicate with other traders, the Competition admins,
    and industry sponsors
  - Gain a chance to show recruiters and the world your trading skills

  Go ahead and join now! We’ll look forward to seeing you in the Discord
  server :)
