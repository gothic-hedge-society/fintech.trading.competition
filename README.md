# Duke FINTECH Trading Competition 2022

Registration for the 2022 Duke FINTECH Trading Competition has now
closed. We are excited to welcome over 170 registrants from 40 colleges
and universities around the world!

At this time, all participants have received welcome materials in their
emails. They have submitted their forms to create paper trader accounts
at [Interactive
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1338&gclid=CjwKCAjw6fCCBhBNEiwAem5SO84OkMDwq8mlx6lCjOmAmCNDUaLbhxtQuFSUlozy6iLEZtmsve2w-hoCQ9sQAvD_BwE).
Because each paper account connects to live data feeds from global
market exchanges, bringing one online is a complex process that can take
several days.

Students can track their overall registration status on the
[Registry](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html)
page, which is updated frequently.

When the participating accounts are ready (anticipating **Tuesday, 25
Jan 2022**), the start of the competition will be announced and scoring
will begin.

After a week or so of trading data is gathered from the participants,
this site will be updated with the latest standings and analytics on the
students’ performance.

# For Participants:

1.  If you haven’t used the link in your IBKR Paper Trader Account
    invitation email to create your paper trader account, do so ASAP.
    Check your spam folder if you don’t find your invitation!
2.  Be sure to join the competition’s Slack channel using the link
    provided in your welcome email. The channel is monitored and is your
    resource for any questions you might have. It’s also a good way to
    talk to other participants.
3.  You may send email to the official trading competition email address
    from which you receive your competition correspondence. If you do
    choose to email…
4.  …**keep all competition email conversations confined to the official
    email address**. Many outstanding faculty at Duke and other
    universities have graciously provided their time and effort to make
    this competition possible, but do not email them directly about
    Competition matters! Use the official email, which is monitored by
    several faculty members.
5.  Especially if you accidentally created more than one IBKR paper
    trader account, don’t forget to check the acount number that appears
    next to your tradername in the
    [Registry](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html).
    That’s the account that this website & app associates with you, and
    that’s the account we’ll be using for scoring. After the first week,
    any extra / inactive accounts will be deleted, so **it’s your
    responsibility to make sure that the account assigned to your
    tradername by the
    [Registry](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html)
    is correct!**
