# Duke FINTECH Trading Competition 2022

The Duke FINTECH Trading Competition is a free competition hosted by the
[FINTECH Program at Duke University](https://fintech.meng.duke.edu/).

The Competition is open to any currently enrolled graduate or
undergraduate student so long as they have an email address with a .edu
extension.

Participating students are issued $1 million in simulated currency
within a paper trading account provided by [Interactive
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1338&gclid=CjwKCAjw6fCCBhBNEiwAem5SO84OkMDwq8mlx6lCjOmAmCNDUaLbhxtQuFSUlozy6iLEZtmsve2w-hoCQ9sQAvD_BwE).
Students will have the opportunity to trade equities, fxed income,
derivatives, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and more, all based on real-time
streaming market data using the same user interface and features
utilized by professional traders.

The FINTECH program at Duke is inclusive and welcoming. Participation is
welcome and encouraged, so please help spread the word! Standings for
the top 10 traders will be posted here and updated daily as data become
available. This site will continue to grow as new features are brought
onboard so be sure to check back often for updates!!!

# Registration

Currently enrolled graduate or undergraduate student with a .edu address
may register for the competition by following these steps:

1.  Visit **LINK** and provide the requested information using your .edu
    email.
    -   You’ll be asked for a trader username – choose wisely! You may
        use your real name if you want, but understand that when daily
        standings and performance updates are pushed to the website,
        this is the name that will appear to the world.
    -   Also remember that the world knows your school, department, and
        username, so use ribald humor at your own risk.
2.  Within one business day, you’ll receive two emails:
    -   a welcome email from Duke FINTECH including an invitation to the
        official trading competition Slack channel
    -   an invitation email from Interactive Brokers (IBKR) for creating
        a new paper trading account
3.  Join the Slack channel
4.  Follow the link in your IBKR invitation email and fill out the
    application for a new paper trading account.
    -   **BE SURE TO RECORD YOUR PAPER TRADING ACCOUNT USERNAME AND
        PASSWORD**. This information will display in a yellow box after
        you submit the form.
    -   You must complete this step and create a new paper trader even
        if you already have a paper trading account with IBKR.
5.  Wait. It takes about **one business day** for your paper trading
    account to activate – most of that time is due to obtaining your
    permissions for market data subscriptions from the various
    exchanges.
6.  Visit the [Getting
    Started](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/fintech-trading-competition.html)
    page. Install TWS and explore the Demo account for a bit while you
    wait for your account to activate.
7.  Once it’s active, you will be able to log in to your paper trader
    using the credentials from **Step 4**.
