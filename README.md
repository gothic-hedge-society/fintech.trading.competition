<p style="font-size:20px;">
The 2023 Duke FINTECH Trading Competition is coming very soon!
</p>

The Duke FinTech Trading Competition is a 3-month long event in which
student traders from around the world create paper trading accounts at
Interactive Brokers and trade anything they want, including stocks,
bonds, options, futures, currencies, crypto, and [any of the other
products offered by Interactive
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/products-invest-prod.php).

If you do well in this competition, it’s because you’re a good trader,
not because you got lucky with some high-risk trades that happened to
pay off. Check out our [scoring
philosophy](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Scoring.html)
to see what makes us special.

As a participating trader in this competition you will:

- Download Trader Workstation (Interactive Brokers’ professional-grade
  trading platform) and use it to trade real assets with real market
  prices using simulated money
- Join the Gothic Hedge Hub (our companion Discord Server) which you can
  use to communicate with other traders, the Competition admins, and
  industry sponsors
- Gain a chance to show recruiters and the world your trading skills
