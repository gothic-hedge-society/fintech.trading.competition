# ABOUT

The Duke FINTECH Trading Competition is a free competition hosted by the
[FINTECH Program at Duke University](https://fintech.meng.duke.edu/).

The Competition is open to any currently enrolled graduate or
undergraduate student so long as they have an email address with a .edu
extension.

Participating students are issued \$1 million in simulated currency
within a paper trading account provided by [Interactive
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1338&gclid=CjwKCAjw6fCCBhBNEiwAem5SO84OkMDwq8mlx6lCjOmAmCNDUaLbhxtQuFSUlozy6iLEZtmsve2w-hoCQ9sQAvD_BwE).
Students will have the opportunity to trade equities, fixed income,
derivatives, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and more, all based on real-time
streaming market data using the same user interface and features
utilized by professional traders.

The FINTECH program at Duke is inclusive and welcoming. Participation is
welcome and encouraged, so please help spread the word! Standings for
the top 10 traders will be posted here and updated daily as data become
available. This site will continue to grow as new features are brought
onboard so be sure to check back often for updates!!!
