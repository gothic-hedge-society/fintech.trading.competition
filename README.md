<h3>15 Jan 2025: Installfest</h3>
<p>
Those located near the Durham NC area are invited to join us at 
<b>2PM EST</b>
 in the 
<b>Fitzpatrick Atrium</b>
 for refreshments. We'll help you install what you need to get 
 signed up for the competition and trading.
</p>
<p>
Starting at 
<b>4pm EST</b>
 we'll be available on the Discord channel to provide support 
and answer questions for those unable to attend in person.
</p>
<h3>22 Jan 2025: PHASE 1: Experimental Trading</h3>
<p>
Many traders have expressed an interest in having an experimental 
phase in which they practice with the Trader Workstation. Based 
on this feedback we'll allow an experimental phase this year. 
During this period we'll still be posting weekly scores as they 
become available.
</p>
<h3>02 Feb 2025: LAST DAY TO REGISTER / RESET ACCOUNT</h3>
<p>
We'll accept new registrants up to the end of the experimental 
phase. Traders will have the right -- but not the obligation -- 
to request one account reset, which will delete all of your 
positions and reset your account balance to $1 million cash. 
If you're happy with your positions, however, you don't have to 
take a reset if you don't want it.
</p>
<h3>05 Feb 2025: PHASE 2: SCORING STARTS</h3>
<p>
This is when we’ll begin keeping score. We will hold a few popup 
help sessions on Discord to help you get set up during the 
experimental phase.
</p>
<h3>03 May 2025: COMPETITION ENDS</h3>
<p>
All of your end-of-day Net Account Values between 05 Feb and 
03 May 2025 will be used in the calculation of your scores, with 
03 May being the final date. After that day the competition will 
be over and winners will be declared.

# ABOUT:

The Duke FinTech Trading Competition is a 3-month long event in which
student traders from around the world create paper trading accounts at
Interactive Brokers and trade anything they want, including stocks,
bonds, options, futures, currencies, crypto, and [any of the other
products offered by Interactive
Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/products-invest-prod.php).

Due to the way in which we score & rank our participants, if you do well
in this competition, it’s because you’re a good trader. Furthermore,
we’ve introduced a *bracket* system this year to keep ALL of our traders
interested and engaged. In the new system, even if you don’t stand much
chance of taking the \#1 spot overall, you can still compete for a top
rank *within your bracket*, giving you a hard-earned accomplishment that
you can report on your resume or CV.

To see how we accompilsh all this – and what makes us special – check
out our [scoring
philosophy](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Scoring.html).

  trading platform) and use it to trade real assets with real market
  prices using simulated money

  industry sponsors
