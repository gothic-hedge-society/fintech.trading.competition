Dear firstname,

You might have already noticed that IBKR's paper account service is down for today -- this happens sometimes after holiday weekends because IBKR will update their system over the holiday.

If you have an active account already, it will work, but for now I'm unable to add in new contest participants.

DO NOT WORRY. If you're getting this email then you're registered for the competition and you'll be receiving a paper trader invite as soon as the system comes back online this evening or tomorrow morning (EST).

I WILL ONLY START SCORING YOUR PERFORMANCE ONCE EVERYONE'S ACCOUNT HAS COME ONLINE. This might be Thursday or Friday, but that's ok -- you can trust me to run things fairly so that nobody has an unfair advantage.

In the meantime, feel free to join the slack channel at: https://join.slack.com/t/2022dukefinte-gho7286/shared_invite/zt-122pv570g-ysNQlBUAyCvxxfGmZx~F4A

Best Regards,
Prof Jake Vestal
