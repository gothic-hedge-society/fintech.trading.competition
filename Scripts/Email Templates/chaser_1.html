Dear <b>tradername</b>,

<p>You have signed up for the 2022 Duke FINTECH Trading Competition and were
    sent an invite email to open an IBKR Paper Trader Account, but <b>as of
        today, 22 Jan at 10AM EST, I do not see an activated paper account
        associated with your tradername</b>.</p>

<p><b>If you have already filled out and submitted your IBKR paper trader
    application</b>:<br>You are OK; your account is being created and we just
    need to wait for it to be created in IBKR's system. However, you can help me
    keep track of this by logging in to the Slack channel and sending me your
    Account ID ('DU' followed by seven numbers; e.g., 'DU1234567') as soon as
    you're able.</p>

<p>My Slack screen name for this competition is '<b>The Architect</b>', and you
    can use <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/2022dukefinte-gho7286/shared_invite/zt-122pv570g-ysNQlBUAyCvxxfGmZx~F4A">this link</a>
    to join the Slack channel if you haven't already.</p>

<p><b>If you have not received a paper trader account invitation from IBKR and
    you still wish to participate in the Competition</b>:<br>Search your inbox
    and Spam folders for the subject line "<b>Paper Trading Account Invitation</b>".
    The email should look like the picture pasted below -- use the link to sign
    up ASAP.</p>

<p><b>If you no longer wish to participate in the 2022 Duke FINTECH Trading Competition</b>:<br>
    You don't need to take any further action. Your account and registration
    will be deleted when we start the competition next week.</p>

<p>If you need any further assistance, please use the Slack channel.</p>

<p>Thank you for your participation! I look forward to trading with you.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
