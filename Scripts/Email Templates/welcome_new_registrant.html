Dear firstname,

Congratulations on registering for the 2022 Duke FINTECH Trading Competition! You have been registered under the username:  yourusername.

This tradername has been logged in the official competition Registry at https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html

Please find an invitation email from Interactive Brokers inviting you to set up a paper trading account for the competition. Fill out and submit the form as soon as possible -- it takes about one business day to process after you've submitted your form. The Registry will be kept updated throughout your onboarding process -- check back for updates around 6pm EST daily.

REMEMBER: It is important that you use the same email for registering with IBKR that you used when registering for the competition!

If you received your IBKR paper trader invite email more than once, don't worry about it -- YOU ONLY HAVE TO SUBMIT THE FORM ONE TIME. Just be sure to record your username, password, and account ID in a safe place.

In the meantime, please join the competition Slack channel using this link: https://join.slack.com/t/2022dukefinte-gho7286/shared_invite/zt-122pv570g-ysNQlBUAyCvxxfGmZx~F4A.
You are welcome to configure your account to display your real name or your trader name.

You may respond to this email address -- which is monitored -- with any questions, but the Slack channel will probably get you the fastest answers.

Best Regards,
Prof Jake Vestal
