<p>TLDR: <strong>You win by making as much money as you possibly can –
using all means available to you – but you’re penalized for
risk</strong>.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="reward-skill-not-luck-">Reward skill, not luck.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reward-skill-not-luck-"></a>
</h2>
<p>Earning returns by managing risk with aplomb is part of the bedrock
of the core values of the Duke FINTECH Program and the Gothic Hedge
Society. We don’t mind taking on risk – so long as we’re appropriately
paid for it. The scoring system used by this Competition was written to
put that principle into practice.</p>
<p>To see the big picture, let’s start with an example. Suppose that at
the end of the Competition we have two students: a reckless gambler
named Wild Bill and a shrewd trader named Clever Susan.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="wild-bill">Wild Bill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#wild-bill"></a>
</h4>
<p>Bill puts all of his money into a tiny, risky startup that has just
been listed on the NASDAQ. He then forgets about it and lets it ride all
semester until the end of the competition, at which time he’s earned an
amazing 250% return!!!! He clearly should win the competition,
right?</p>
<p>Well… when you look at the value of Wild Bill’s performance, it was
all over the map during the competition. As news was released about the
startup, Bill was down as much as -300% on some days, and up as high as
375% because the tiny company’s price was fluctuating so much.</p>
<p>That means, that if Wild Bill had had a cash emergency or needed to
close his position and withdraw his investment at any time, there’s no
telling how much he’d have had available on a given day. Maybe he’d have
a lot of cash, maybe not much at all.</p>
<p>In fact, the next day after the competition, Bill’s gains were wiped
out and he was down a full -50% from where he started, meaning that in
reality, Bill just got lucky that the competition ended when it did.
Clearly, there’s more to the story here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="clever-susan">Clever Susan<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clever-susan"></a>
</h4>
<p>Susan takes a different approach. She creates a well-balanced
portfolio of different assets in different market sectors, and at the
end of the competition she posts a very healthy 12% return – much less
than Wild Bill.</p>
<p>However, the value of Susan’s portfolio grew steadily and predictably
through the competition. On her worst day, she had still earned a return
of 8%, but upon the whole it never varied too much from 12%.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="so-who-should-win-wild-bill-or-clever-susan">So who should win– Wild Bill or Clever Susan?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#so-who-should-win-wild-bill-or-clever-susan"></a>
</h2>
<p>The Gothic Hedge Society believes it should be Susan because
otherwise the Competition turns into a simple gamble on who’s NAV will
be the highest on the day the Competition ends.</p>
<p>That poses the following problem when it comes to designing a scoring
system: how do we rank trader performance in a way that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>consistent &amp; fair for all traders</li>
<li>quantifiable</li>
<li>relatively straightforward to calculate, communicate, and
understand?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll need a metric somewhat more sophisticated than simple return to
satisfy those requirements, one that takes into account both
<strong>average return</strong> of a trader’s porfolio over time as well
as the <strong>volatility</strong> of those returns.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <strong>Sharpe Ratio</strong> is just such a metric.
For you, the trader, your Sharpe Ratio is a measure of your
<em>risk-adjusted return</em>; in other words, how much money you made
vs. the risk that you took on.</p>
<p>There are two main postulates behind the Sharpe ratio that you should
think about deeply if you’re new to this. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>volatility is defined as the standard deviation of the returns that
a portfolio earns over time</li>
<li>volatility is a good measure of risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Posting a high Sharpe ratio during a time period means that your
portfolio earned a big return comparable to the volatility of your
account’s value during that time – and that’s good.</p>
<p>Before we move on to <strong>calculating</strong> the Sharpe ratio
with concrete numbers, there are a few more concepts you should become
familiar with. Read on!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="concept-the-risk-free-rate-r_f">CONCEPT: The Risk-Free Rate
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r_{f}</annotation></semantics></math><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concept-the-risk-free-rate-r_f"></a>
</h2>
<p>Think about all the investments out there – is there one that will
earn you a GAURANTEED return – a sure thing, with zero volatility?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is “no”, but US Treasury bills (T-Bills) come
pretty close for practical purposes.</p>
<p>At any time, just about anybody can simply buy a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions-,What%20Is%20a%20Treasury%20Bill%3F,sold%20in%20denominations%20of%20%241%2C000" class="external-link">T-Bill</a>
from the US Government or another large sovereign nation. The thinking
is that if a big country like the US defaults (doesn’t pay) a T-Bill
debt at maturity, then something is so terribly wrong with the economy,
the world political situation, etc., that nobody is worried about
finance anymore… they’re worried about surviving the space alien
invasion, global war, or other major disaster that must have taken place
to cause the country to default. Obviously this turn of events would be
very bad, but fortunately, the prevailing financial thinking is that the
likelihood of such an occurrence is so low that its probability can be
assumed to be 0.</p>
<p>In other words, these investments are thought of as <strong>risk
free</strong>.</p>
<p>Holders of these assets receive a return, of course. The exact
percentage varies but whatever its value, we refer to it using the
symbol
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r_{f}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<p>Since they’re ‘risk-free’, traders should just buy government bonds,
earn a zero-risk return, and forget about complex strategies, right?
Well… you could do that, but because the investment is risk-free and
easily available, it doesn’t (historically) pay very much.</p>
<p>The US Department of the Treasury compiles daily risk-free rates and
publishes them on their <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield" class="external-link">website</a>,
where you can go to view &amp; download the rates and learn about the
methodology the USDT uses to calculate them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="concept-daily-log-returns">CONCEPT: Daily Log Returns<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concept-daily-log-returns"></a>
</h2>
<p>In the Competition, your return is calculated each day by observing
the Net Asset Value (NAV) of your account – the total end-of-day value
of everything you own.</p>
<p>“Today’s” NAV is compared to “yesterday’s” to calculate the percent
return you realized “today”.</p>
<p>That means that over a period of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>N</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math>
days, we’ll have
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N - 1</annotation></semantics></math>
total observations of a portfolio’s return because you can’t measure a
return for the very first day – you have nothing to compare it to.</p>
<p>The formula used to calculate the return you earned on your portfolio
is the log ratio of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>N</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V_{N}</annotation></semantics></math>
– the value of your portfolio on Day
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>N</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math>
– divided by

– the portfolio’s value on the previous day; i.e.,

<p>In the competition, daily log returns are calculated for every
student’s portfolio as soon as the data becomes available for that day
(usually after about 6pm EST on a trading day).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="concept-average-expected-return">CONCEPT: Average (“Expected”) Return<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concept-average-expected-return"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: We use the geometric mean of
period-over-period log returns.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>: Let’s say you invest $100k into an
investment portfolio. Each quarter, you measure the return you earned at
the quarter’s end with respect to the how much the portfolio was worth
at the beginning of the portfolio. You observe the returns +25%, -25%,
+25%, -25% for each quarter. In other words, an initial investment of
$100k would be worth $125k, $100k, $125k, and $100k at the ends of
quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.</p>
<p>In this context, when you discuss means of a sample of returns, what
you’re really asking is something like , <strong>what’s the overall
return that characterizes this investment’s performance at any given
time over the period</strong>?</p>
<p>There are infinite ways of answering this question (the doubters may
start by Googling “Harmonic Mean”, or maybe “Lehmer Mean” to start
convincing themselves of the truth of this statement).</p>
<p>This vignette focuses on only two means, discussed below.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="arithmetic-mean">Arithmetic Mean<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#arithmetic-mean"></a>
</h4>
<p>You might think: “just take the average” of the returns, which works
out to 2.5%. But that’s not quite descriptive of the whole picture is
it… after all, if you tell a client that you earned an average of 2.5%
on their investment of $100k, then they’d naturally expect to see
something around $102.5k when they look up the value of the account
right?</p>
<p>…but the value of the account is $100k, meaning that you’re probably
going to have a client banging your door down wondering where their
$2,500 went. The “normal average”, more properly called the
<strong>arithmetic mean</strong> of the returns is therefore misleading
in this way!</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="geometric-mean-rate-of-return-gmrr">Geometric Mean Rate of Return (GMRR)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#geometric-mean-rate-of-return-gmrr"></a>
</h4>
<p>A better way to assign an overall characteristic (“expected”) return
for a time series of returns is to use the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/geometricmean.asp#:~:text=The%20geometric%20mean%20differs%20from,returns%20than%20the%20arithmetic%20mean" class="external-link">geometric
mean</a>, calculated by converting all of the returns into
<em>factors</em> by adding 1, multiplying them all together, and taking
the
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math>th
root, where
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math>
is the number of returns observed in the period. Finally, convert
resulting factor back into a percent by subtracting 1.</p>
<p>In symbols, the <strong>geometric mean</strong> of a series of
returns over
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math>
periods can be expressed as
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msup><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><msubsup><mo>∏</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>n</mi></msubsup><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>n</mi></mfrac></msup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}R_{i}\right)^\frac{1}{n}</annotation></semantics></math>,
or, equivelantly:
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mroot><mrow><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mi>R</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mi>.</mi><mi>.</mi><mi>.</mi><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><mi>n</mi></mroot><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt[n]{R_{1}R_{1}R_{1}...R_{n}}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
<p>You can check the numbers from the example above to see that the GMRR
for the investment is 0, just as it should be.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="concept-excess-return">CONCEPT: Excess Return<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concept-excess-return"></a>
</h2>
<p>You’re going to be managing a portfolio – some set of bonds, stocks,
currency trades, etc, on which you earn a <strong>portfolio
return</strong>
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>p</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R_{p}</annotation></semantics></math>.
As an investor, you only care about earning a return that is
<em>better</em> than the risk-free rate
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>f</mi></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r_{f}</annotation></semantics></math>
because otherwise, why are you even bothering to invest? Better to just
buy government debt.</p>
<p>In other words, what you really care about is your portfolio’s
<strong>Excess Return</strong> over the risk free rate.</p>
<p><strong>Excess Return is defined as the difference between the return
your portfolio earned and the return that was available by buying
sovereign debt during a certain time period</strong>; in other words,

<p>Earlier in this vignette we presented the two postulates that amount
to the idea that, for a trader’s account, if we measure the return
earned each day with respect to the day before, then <strong>volatility
= standard_deviation(returns) = risk</strong>. Standard deviation of a
portfolio’s returns is a concrete value that we can understand and
calculate, and we assign to it the symbol

<p>Now we can put it all together and, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/sr/SR.htm" class="external-link">as William Sharpe
did in 1966</a>, write down a metric that goes <em>down</em> when
expected return goes down &amp; volatility goes up, and <em>up</em> when
expected return goes up and volatility goes down:</p>

</h2>
<p>Let’s say you go to a market that is selling “return”, which it
quantifies in units of percent “%”. You can buy returns of 5%, 500%,
-0.2%, and so on, but you have to pay. But what payment will the market
accept?</p>
<p>The idea behind Sharpe’s ratio is: <em>you can buy (or sell)
‘return’, but you have to pay by taking on (or divesting) ‘risk’, of
which volatility is a measure</em>.</p>
<p>Look back at the definition of the Sharpe ratio and see that it has
units of “% return” in the numerator, and “% risk” in the denominator.
That’s not an accident- the Sharpe ratio is, at it’s core, the “price”
of an asset or portfolio in terms of its “risk”.</p>
<p>In general, better traders have higher Sharpe ratios because they’re
