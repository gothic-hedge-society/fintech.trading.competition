<p>If you’ve made it to this page, you’re looking to understand how we
assign rankings to each trader to determine a winner. In order to
proceed, you should have already read and understood the <a href="https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Scoring.html">General
Idea behind our scoring philosophy</a> to get an idea of what we’re
seeking to do; to wit: reward those traders who make a lot of money, but
do so intelligently rather than just getting lucky.</p>
<p>The process described below is performed daily when standings are
updated.</p>
<div class="section level2">

</h2>
<p>For every participaiting trader, every day as soon as new end-of-day
NAV values become available, we calculate excess return and Sharpe ratio
as described in <a href="https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Sharpe%20Ratio%20Calculation.html">Sharpe
Ratio Calculation</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that we have 50 traders in the competition and on this
particular day we run the query, do the calculations, and end up with
the following stats:</p>
