<p>Another rough week brought in some new faces to the top tier! Welcome
to <strong>Boluo</strong>, <strong>usersandra</strong>, <strong>Dhanush
Binu</strong>, <strong>z6fan</strong>. Markets remain volatile as we
enter into a new regime, and the competition is still anyone’s game to
win. Special congratulations go out to <strong>161803</strong> (who
we’ll call ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi" class="external-link">Phil</a>’) for
posting a massive GMRR of 0.8% <em>per trading day</em>. Phil earned
this return by betting against the SP500 with a beta of -1.05, which so
far has been a winning bet. Let’s see if he can keep it up!</p>
<p>It’s impressive how many traders have managed to hedge out volatility
and remain posting positive returns with good Sharpes. Congrats to
all!</p>
<p><strong>be sure to check out our new feature:</strong> <a href="https://fintechtradingcompetition.com/articles/traderpage.html" class="external-link">traderpages</a></p>

<h2 id="current-rankings">Current Rankings<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#current-rankings"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>gmrr</strong>, <strong>vol</strong>, and
<strong>sharpe</strong> are calculated on a per-trading day basis using
end-of-day Net Asset Values of each trader’s account. See <a href="https://fintechtradingcompetition.com/articles/Scoring.html" class="external-link">the
scoring section</a> for an in-depth explaination.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>rank</strong>: overall ranking in the competition. Your
tier appears as the whole number and your ranking within your tier
appears as a decimal; for example, Trader 3.4 is ranked #4 in the 3rd
tier.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>gmrr</strong>: Geometric mean of rate of return</p></li>
<li><p><strong>vol</strong>: Volatility of returns</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sharpe</strong>: (<em>gmrr</em> - <em>rf</em>) /
<em>vol</em></p></li>
