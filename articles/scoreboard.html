<p>This past week was one for the storybooks – maybe the most difficult
week to be a trader in the Competition’s entire four year history. The
market corrections that took place caused major shakeup in the
rankings.</p>
<p>Many of the top-tier traders for this week have pursued a
‘sit-and-wait’ strategy. They’re posting numbers that are identical to 4
digits of precision because they plan to earn the risk-free rate until
they choose to take a position; until then, they plan to accumulate
interest. Meanwhile, other traders in the competition who took positions
– and were doing well for the first few weeks – posted losses last week
due to the big correction and were knocked out of the top tier by the
‘do nothing’ strategy.</p>
<p>It’s expected that traders who post a return as a result of trading
activity in the new market regime will replace the ‘hold steady’ group
in the top tier, because membership in the top tier is based on overall
achieved return. Furthermore, there exists real and increasing pressure
for those in the ‘wait-it-out’ group to make an attempt to take the
lead… which brings with it significant risk.</p>
<p>With 2 months left in the competition it’s still anyone’s game! Check
back here for more updates as well as additional analysis and
reporting.</p>
<p>Major congratulations this week to everyone in the top tier, but
especially the top 3 traders that did <strong>not</strong> get
demolished by the turmoil of ‘interesting times’. Shoutout to
<strong>demdition</strong>, <strong>161803</strong>, and <strong>Timothy
Nguyen</strong> – you guys are still standing. Posting a positive Sharpe
in this market takes serious skill and you guys are to be commended.</p>
<p>This year is truly fascinating. The winner will be the trader who
adapts, lets go of past losses, and focuses on the future. Happy hunting
to everyone!</p>
