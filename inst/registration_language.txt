Currently enrolled graduate or undergraduate students with a .edu address may
register for the competition by following these steps:

1. Visit the [registration page](https://dukefinance.wufoo.com/forms/2022-duke-fintech-trading-competition/)  
and provide the requested information using your .edu email. 
    - You'll be asked for a trader username -- choose wisely! You may use your
    real name if you want, but understand that when daily standings and
    performance updates are pushed to the website, this is the name that will
    appear to the world alongside your school, department, and username.
2. Within one business day, you'll receive two emails:
    - A welcome email from Duke FINTECH including an invitation to the official
    trading competition Slack channel
    - An invitation email from Interactive Brokers (IBKR) for creating a new
    paper trading account
3. Join the Slack channel
4. Follow the link in your IBKR invitation email and fill out the application
for a new paper trading account. 
    - **BE CERTAIN TO RECORD YOUR PAPER TRADING ACCOUNT NUMBER, USERNAME AND PASSWORD**.
    This information will display in a yellow box after you submit the form.
    - **BE CERTAIN TO USE THE SAME EMAIL THAT YOU USED TO REGISTER FOR THE COMPETITION**.
    We'll be using your email to join your paper trader to account to your 
    registration info (tradername, school, etc) for the competition so it's 
    important that these match.
    - **DO THIS AS SOON AS YOU CAN**
    - use the Slack channel to ask for help if you need it.
    - You must complete this step and create a new paper trader even if you
    already have a paper trading account with IBKR.
5. Wait. It takes about **one business day** for your paper trading account
to activate -- most of that time is due to obtaining your permissions for market
data subscriptions from the various exchanges.
6. Visit the [Getting Started](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/fintech-trading-competition.html) 
page. Install TWS and explore the Demo account for a bit while you wait for your
account to activate.
7. Once it's active, you will be able to log in to your paper trader using the
credentials from **Step 4**. Your username will be a simple alphanumeric string
like "jakev9914". Test that your account is live by logging in to TWS.
8. Check the [Registry](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html)
to confirm that the tradername you've chosen appears alongside the correct
account number of your paper trader.
9. Once your tradername appears alongside your paper trader's account number,
you're all set! You're encouraged to say 'hi' in the Slack channel.
