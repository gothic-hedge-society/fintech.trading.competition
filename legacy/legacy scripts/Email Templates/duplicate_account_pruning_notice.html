Dear <b>name</b>,

<p>You have created multiple IBKR paper trader accounts for the competition.</p>

<p>The account I have listed for you in the <a href="https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html">Registry</a>
    is the one you're slated to use for the competition.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I will be deleting your duplicate account <b>duplicate_account</b>.</p>

<p>If this is in error, please let me know by the end of the day today.</p>

<p>Thanks and Best Regards,</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Prof Jake Vestal<br>
