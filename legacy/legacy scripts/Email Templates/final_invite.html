The Trading Competition gives university students the opportunity to develop
and try out investment strategies by trading real financial assets - using
real-time market data - without committing actual capital.

Participating students will be issued $1 million in simulated currency within
a paper trading account at Interactive Brokers (NYSE: IBKR,
https://www.interactivebrokers.com/). Students will make trades within their
paper accounts and gain exposure to the same user interface and features
utilized by live accounts at Interactive Brokers.
