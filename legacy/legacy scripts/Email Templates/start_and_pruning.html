Dear <b>first_name</b>,

<p>The 2022 FINTECH Trading Competition is underway! Thanks to all those who
    participated in the Kickoff meeting with their questions and comments.</p>

<p>This start date has been announced on the <a href="http://www.fintechtradingcompetition.com">Main Site</a>.</p>

<p>The scoring of the competition is set to begin on <b>Tuesday, 25 Jan 2022</b>.
Be aware that <b>tonight is the last night to complete your paper trading
        account registration</b> in order to be ready on time! Traders who don't
    have accounts set up won't be able to participate and will be removed from
    the Competition -- unless you're a 'limbo case' and you have let me know
    your account is in the process of being set up by following the instructions
    on the <a href="https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/sign_up.html">Sign Up page</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html">Registry</a>
    has been fully updated at this time, including those 'limbo' cases whose
    accounts aren't ready now, but will be by Tuesday. <b>Please check the Registry</b> and make
    sure the info I have for you is correct -- this is your last chance before
    the Competition begins.</p>

<p>Thank you for your participation! I'm very excited to get this going.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Prof Jake Vestal<br>
