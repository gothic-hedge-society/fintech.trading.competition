Dear <b>first_name</b>,

<p>Congratulations, you are registered for the 2022 Duke FINTECH Trading
    Competition! As published on the <a href="https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html">Registry</a>,
    the Competition app has the following account information associated with
    your profile:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Trader Name</b>: tradername</li>

</ul>

<p>If this information is <b>correct</b>:<br>You are set up and don't need to
    take any further action. Please wait paitently for the other contestants to
    come online.</p>

<p>If this information is <b>not correct</b>:<br>Let me know ASAP by sending me
    a Slack message. My Slack screen name for this competition is '<b>The
        Architect</b>', and you can use <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/2022dukefinte-gho7286/shared_invite/zt-122pv570g-ysNQlBUAyCvxxfGmZx~F4A">this link</a>
    to join the Slack channel if you haven't already.</p>

<p>I'm getting the impression that just about everyone who still intends to
    participate has submitted their paper trader forms already; therefore, I'm
    still hoping to officially start scoring the competition on <b>Tuesday, 25
        Jan 2022</b>.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for promptly filling out your materials, and thank you for
    your patience as I help others get squared away.</p>

<p>If you need any further assistance, please use the Slack channel.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br>
Prof Jake Vestal<br>
