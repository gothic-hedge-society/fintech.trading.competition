# Rules
1. Registration ENDS on Wednesday, 19 Jan 2022 at 9:30am EST. No new
participants may sign up after that date.
  - You can start trading as soon as your IBKR paper trader account activates, 
  but realize that **we'll only start scoring the competition once everyone's 
  trader is set up**.
  - We'll use the rule of reasonableness here -- it sometimes takes a few days
  for a paper trader account to get connected to market exchanges and activate,
  but we won't delay the start of the competition simply because some
  participants choose to not make a good faith effort to get set up promtly.
  - Use the Slack channel and check back on this website as needed.
2. The competition will end on Wednesday, 13 Apr 2022 at 4pm EST.
3. You can begin making trades as soon as you like, but only your end-of-day
portfolio values within these dates (inclusive) will be used for scoring.
Because the competition is scored based on Sharpe Ratio, it doesn't matter if
different participants begin the competition with different positions and cash.
4. If your account isn't activated by the start of the competition, then you
aren't eligible to participate so be sure to activate early!
5. Scoring will be based on Sharpe Ratio (highest wins). Please see the
following pages for more detailed information:

    - [Sharpe Ratio Calculation](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/Sharpe%20Ratio%20Calculation.html)
6. **No account resets are allowed**. Be sure that any orders you make on your
trading account are what you want -- use the Demo account features for practice.
7. **You must make one trade during the first week**. If you don't trade during
the first week, your account will be deleted, your tradername will be removed
from the Registry and from the Slack channel, and a "dropout" note will be added
to your University. If you don't want to trade during the first week, then
simply make a small trade such as buying one share of the many 'penny stocks'
available for $5 USD or less to satisfy this requirement. If you can't access
your account, ask for help on the Slack channel.
