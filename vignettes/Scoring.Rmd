## Bottom Line
**You win by making as much money as you possibly can -- using all means 
available to you -- but you're penalized for risk (volatility)**.

## Example: Reckless Trader & Shrewd Trader (Bill & Susan)
Let's say that at the end of the competition we have two students: a reckless
gambler named Wild Bill and a shrewd trader named Clever Susan.

#### Wild Bill
Bill puts all of his money into a tiny, risky startup that has just been listed
on the NASDAQ. He then forgets about it and lets it ride all semester until the 
end of the competition, at which time he's earned an amazing 250% return!!!! He 
clearly should win the competition, right?

Well... when you look at the value of Wild Bill's performance, it was all over
the map during the competition. As news was released about the startup, Bill was
down as much as -300% on some days, and up as high as 375% because the tiny
company's price was fluctuating so much. 

That means, that if Wild Bill had had a cash emergency or needed to close his
position and withdraw his investment at any time, there's no telling how much
he'd have had available on a given day. Maybe he'd have a lot of cash, maybe not
much at all.

In fact, the next day after the competition, Bill's gains were wiped out and he
was down a full -50% from where he started, meaning that in reality, Bill just
got lucky that the competition ended when it did. Clearly, there's more to the
story here.

## The Risk-Free Rate $r_{f}$

At any time, just about anybody can simply buy a
[T-Bill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp#:~:text=Frequently%20Asked%20Questions-,What%20Is%20a%20Treasury%20Bill%3F,sold%20in%20denominations%20of%20%241%2C000)
from the US Government or another large sovereign nation. The thinking is that
if a big country like the US defaults (doesn't pay) a T-Bill debt at maturity,
then something is so terribly wrong with the economy, the world political
situation, etc., that nobody is worried about finance anymore... they're worried
about surviving the space alien invasion, global war, or other major disaster
that must have taken place to cause the country to default. Obviously this turn
of events would be very bad, but fortunately, the prevailing financial thinking
is that the likelihood of such an occurrence is so low that its probability can
be assumed to be 0.

In other words, these investments are thought of as **risk free**, to which we
assign the symbol $r_{f}$.

So just buy government bonds, earn a zero-risk return, and forget about it,
right? Well... you could, but becuase the investment is risk-free and easily
available, it doesn't pay very much.

The US Department of the Treasury compiles daily risk-free rates and publishes
them on their
[website](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield),
where you can go to view & download the rates and learn about the methodology
the USDT uses to calculate them.

## Daily Log Returns
Your return is calculated each day by observing the end-of-day value of all your
assets and comparing it to the end-of-day value on the day before. That means
that over a period of $N$ days, we'll have $N - 1$ total observations of a
portfolio's return because you can't measure a return for the very first day --
you have nothing to compare it to.

The formula used to calculate the return you earned on your portfolio is the log
ratio of $V_{N}$ -- the value of your portfolio on Day $N$ -- divided by
$V_{N-1}$ -- the portfolio's value on the previous day; i.e., $R_{N} =
\log(\frac{V_{N}}{V_{N-1}})$.

In the competition, daily log returns are calculated for every student's
portfolio and for the risk-free rate.

## Average ("Expected") Return
**TLDR**: We use the geometric mean of period-over-period log returns.

**Details**: Let's say you invest $100k into an investment portfolio. Each
quarter, you measure the return you earned at the quarter's end with respect to
the how much the portfolio was worth at the beginning of the portfolio. You
observe the returns +25%, -25%, +25%, -25% for each quarter. In other words, an
initial investment of $100k would be worth $125k, $100k, $125k, and $100k at the
ends of quarters 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

The question is, **what's the overall return that characterizes this
investment's performance over the year**?

#### Arithmetic Mean
You might think: "just take the average" of the returns, which works out to
2.5%. But that's not quite descriptive of the whole picture is it... after all,
if you tell a client that you earned an average of 2.5% on their investment of
$100k, then they'd naturally expect to see something around $102.5k when they
look up the value of the account right?

...but the value of the account is $100k, meaning that you're probably going to
have a client banging your door down wondering where their $2,500 went. The
"normal average", more properly called the **arithmetic mean** of the returns is
therefore misleading in this way!

#### Geometric Mean
A better way to assign an overall charactaristic ("expected") return for a time
series of returns is to use the [geometric
mean](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/geometricmean.asp#:~:text=The%20geometric%20mean%20differs%20from,returns%20than%20the%20arithmetic%20mean),
calculated by multiplying all of the returns together and taking the $n$th root,
where $n$ is the number of returns observed in the period. The **geometric
mean** of a series of returns over $n$ periods can be expressed as two
equivalent formulae $\left(\prod_{i=1}^{n}R_{i}\right)^\frac{1}{n}$ and
$\sqrt[n]{R_{1}R_{1}R_{1}...R_{n}}$.

Note that, in the example above, the geometric mean rate of return for the
investment is 0, just as it should be.

## Excess Return
You're going to be managing a portfolio -- some set of bonds, stocks, currency
trades, etc, on which you earn a **portfolio return** $R_{p}$. As an investor,
you only care about earning a return that is *better* than the risk-free rate
$r_{f}$ because otherwise, why are you even bothering to invest? Better to just
buy government debt.

In other words, what you really care about is your portfolio's **Excess Return**
over the risk free rate.

**Excess Return is defined as the difference between the return your portfolio
earned and the return that was available by buying sovereign debt during a
certain time period**; in other words, $R_{p} - r_{f}$.

## Volatility (Risk)
For a series of returns, the **volatility** (or "vol", for short) is defined as
the standard deviation of the observed returns. In finance, **risk** is thought
to be defined as **volatility**. A portfolio's vol is assigned the symbol
$\sigma^{2}_{p}$.

## The Sharpe Ratio
Now we can put it all together and, [as William Sharpe did in
1966](http://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/sr/SR.htm), write down a metric that
goes *down* when expected return goes down & vol goes up, and *up* when expected
return goes up and vol goes down:

\begin{align*}
{\tt Sharpe\ Ratio} = \frac{R_{p} - r_{f}}{\sigma^{2}_{p}} 
\end{align*}

#### Wherein:

\begin{align*}
R_{p} & {\sf: Portfolio\ Return} \\
r_{f} & {\sf: Risk\ free\ rate\ of\ return} \\
\sigma^{2}_{p} & {\sf: Volatility\ of\ portfolio\ return}
\end{align*}
