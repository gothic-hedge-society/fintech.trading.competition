While you're creating your paper trading account, you'll encounter instructions
from  Interactive Brokers (IBKR) regarding how to access your account for
trading. 

To get started, it's recommended you select from one of the three recommended
client apps, outlined below:

### 0) Register for the Competition
To register, all you need is to be a current graduate or undergrad student at an
accredited university with a .edu email address. Follow the link posted on the
main page to sign up. **At this time, registration for the Spring 2021 session
is closed, but we are extremely excited to welcome students for the next session
in the fall**!

### 1) Trader Workstation (TWS)

The Trader Workstation is IBKR's client app that connects to the brokerage and
allows you to make trades and view real-time market data, including news &
bulletins. TWS is intended to be installed on your computer (Mac, Windows,
Unix) and can be customized to your liking following the documentation on IBKR's home page.

To install TWS, you'll want to visit the 
[TWS download page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16040) and
install the correct version for your system. Log in using your IBKR credentials
and start trading!

### 2) IBKR Mobile

Interactive Brokers offers a mobile app from which you can access your account
to make trade and view market data. The app is available on 
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atws.app&hl=en_US&gl=US)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibkr-mobile-invest-worldwide/id454558592).


### 3) IB Gateway (IBG)

IB Gateway is identical to TWS in every way except that there is no graphical
user interface (GUI) -- you're expected to connect to a running instance of IBG
using one of the various APIs made available by IBKR. To download, visit the
[IBG download page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16457).

### Traders' University

IBKR maintains a set of videos on their [Traders' University](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1350) site where
you can learn about the different financial instruments and how to trade them
using your system of choice.
