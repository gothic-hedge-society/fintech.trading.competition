This page walks through what you as a participating trader need to do to fully 
**sign up** for the Competition, including all the downloads that you'll need to 
be able to trade.

For starters, this competition consists of three components that you'll use:

- The **website** that you're on right now (+ its backend, which does all the 
  heavy lifting and calculating)
- An 'educator-level' **paper trading account** run by the [Student Trading
  Lab](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/educator.php) at
  Interactive Brokers (IBKR). This is what participants will use to make their 
  trades and monitor market data.
- A **Discord Server**. This is where participants can interact with each other,
  the competition admins, and Partner-level sponsors & above (when they choose 
  to sign in and make themselves available)
  
**If you're a currently enrolled university student (grad or undergrad) then 
you're eligible to join!**

### Step 1: Make a Discord account (if you don't have one already)
Discord accounts are required for the competition this year for several reasons:

 - Jake Vestal (The Architect) and Zoe Kim (The Pastry Chef) -- the Competition 
 admins -- are going to be doing Discord livestreams at various times and 
 various reasons (or no reason at all) throughout this Competition, some of 
 which won't be posted to YouTube. They're sure to be helpful at best, 
 entertaining at a minimum :)
 - You'll use Discord to communicate with each other...
 - ...receive announcements as they take place...
 - ...and communicate with Competition admins in case you encounter an issue.
 
But perhaps most importantly:
 - **We're allowing some sponsors to join certain channels on the Competition 
 discord for recruiting**, so you definitely want to participate.

You can make an account and download Discord [here](https://discord.com/). You 
are probably going to want to download the app on your desktop and your phone.

### Step 2: Fill out & submit this form:
<div id="wufoo-div" style="background-color:#fff;border-style:ridge;">
<div id="wufoo-q7j67ol08e8luq" style => Fill out my <a href="https://dukefinance.wufoo.com/forms/q7j67ol08e8luq">online form</a>. </div> <script type="text/javascript"> var q7j67ol08e8luq; (function(d, t) { var s = d.createElement(t), options = { 'userName':'dukefinance', 'formHash':'q7j67ol08e8luq', 'autoResize':true, 'height':'866', 'async':true, 'host':'wufoo.com', 'header':'show', 'ssl':true }; s.src = ('https:' == d.location.protocol ?'https://':'http://') + 'secure.wufoo.com/scripts/embed/form.js'; s.onload = s.onreadystatechange = function() { var rs = this.readyState; if (rs) if (rs != 'complete') if (rs != 'loaded') return; try { q7j67ol08e8luq = new WufooForm(); q7j67ol08e8luq.initialize(options); q7j67ol08e8luq.display(); } catch (e) { } }; var scr = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0], par = scr.parentNode; par.insertBefore(s, scr); })(document, 'script'); </script></div>

After you complete Step 2, the Competition admins will receive it and send you two things:

  - an invite to join the Trading Competition's Discord server 
  - an invite to create your trading account at Interactive Brokers. 
  
You need to do both of these steps in order to be fully registered. We're 
working on automating the invites but for now, allow a max of 24 hours from the 
time you submit in Step 2 to the time you receive your invites.

When you get them, you can proceed:

### Step 3: Join the Gothic Hedge Hub (the Competition's Discord server)
Look for your Discord invite within the Discord app and join the server! Leave
us an intro note in the General channel or something.

### Step 4: Create your paper trading account
Monitor **the university email address that you provided in Step 2** for an 
invite link to create a paper trading account for this year's competition!

  - Yes, you absolutely must create a new account even if you already have one
  
### Step 5: Confirm access to your paper trading account
After a day or two (it varies, and usually your client portal activates first) 
you should be able to log in to the IBKR account you created in two ways:

  1. The [Client Portal](https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login?forwardTo=22&locale=en_US)
    is your account management website where you can view basic info about your
    account, including statements, balances, and trading activity.

  2. Trader Workstation (TWS)
  TWS is IBKR's graphical client app that connects to the brokerage and allows 
  you to make trades and view real-time market data, including news & bulletins. 
  TWS is intended to be installed on your computer and can be customized to your
  liking following the documentation on IBKR's home page.

  To install TWS, you'll want to visit the [TWS download page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16040) 
  and install the correct version for your system. Log in using your IBKR 
  credentials and start trading!


There are two other ways to access your account:

### IBKR Mobile

Interactive Brokers offers a mobile app from which you can access your account
to make trades and view market data. The app is available on 
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atws.app&hl=en_US&gl=US)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibkr-mobile-invest-worldwide/id454558592).


### IB Gateway (IBG)

IB Gateway is identical to TWS in every way except that there is no graphical
user interface (GUI) -- you're expected to connect to a running instance of IBG
using one of the various APIs made available by IBKR. To download, visit the
[IBG download page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16457).
Use this if you plan on making trades with an external system such as an app
you've written in a language like R or Python.

Finally, for learning, tutorials, & so on:

### Traders' University

IBKR maintains a set of videos on their [Traders' University](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1350) 
site where you can learn about the different financial instruments and how to
trade them using your system of choice.

Also be aware that Jake & Zoe will be giving educational sessions on how to use 
IBKR's system on Discord from time to time.
