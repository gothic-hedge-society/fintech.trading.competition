There are three (3) main apps available for Mac, Windows, and Unix that allow
you to access your trading account once it's been set up. If you've just filled
out your IBKR paper trading form and are waiting for it to activate, you might
be interested to experiment with the "demo" option available in each app. You
can even make trades while you're logged in as 'demo', but your positions and
earnings won't be saved and won't count towards competition scoring in any way.

You'll need to install one or more of these apps to be able to manage your
account. Each is described below.

It is highly recommended that you download and use Trader Workstation (TWS), at
least at first, so that you can familiarize yourself with important operations
such as trade order entry, charting, the various financial assets, and so on in
a graphical environment.

### 0) Client Portal

The [Client Portal](https://ndcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/sso/Login?forwardTo=22&locale=en_US)
is your account management website where you can view basic info about your
account, including statements, balances, and trading activity.

### 1) Trader Workstation (TWS)

TWS is IBKR's graphical client app that connects to the brokerage and allows you
to make trades and view real-time market data, including news & bulletins. TWS
is intended to be installed on your computer and can be customized to your
liking following the documentation on IBKR's home page.

To install TWS, you'll want to visit the 
[TWS download page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16040) and
install the correct version for your system. Log in using your IBKR credentials
and start trading!

### 2) IBKR Mobile

Interactive Brokers offers a mobile app from which you can access your account
to make trade and view market data. The app is available on 
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=atws.app&hl=en_US&gl=US)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibkr-mobile-invest-worldwide/id454558592).


### 3) IB Gateway (IBG)

IB Gateway is identical to TWS in every way except that there is no graphical
user interface (GUI) -- you're expected to connect to a running instance of IBG
using one of the various APIs made available by IBKR. To download, visit the
[IBG download page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=16457).
Use this if you plan on making trades with an external system such as an app
you've written in a language like R or Python.

### Traders' University

IBKR maintains a set of videos on their [Traders' University](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1350) 
site where you can learn about the different financial instruments and how to
trade them using your system of choice.
