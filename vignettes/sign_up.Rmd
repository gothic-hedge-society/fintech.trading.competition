## How it Works
From a technical standpoint, this competition consists of four main components:

- This **website**, which communicates Competition information
- The **app**, which performs all the ranking and scoring calculations,
  handles registration and emailing, renders this website, stores data, etc
- An 'educator-level' **paper trading account** run by the [Student Trading
  Lab](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/educator.php) at
  Interactive Brokers (IBKR)
- A **Slack Channel** for participants to use for communicating with Contest
  admin, tech support, and general chatting

When you sign up on this website (**Step 1**, below), you're making it known to
us here at the Competition that you're interested in participating by providing
us with your University email address, your chosen tradername, and some other
basic information. Once you complete this form, the Competition will **invite**
you to create a paper trading account at Interactive Brokers.

This process is almost identical to how a professional Financial Advisor (FA)
onboards a new client: once the client expresses a wish to have the FA invest on
the client's behalf, the FA will 'invite' the client within the FA's own Account
Management system. The client gets an invitation email to set up their account
and follows the instructions. When complete, the client will have set up a fully
functional trading account to which the FA has full visibility and permissions. 

Our process works the same way -- when you get your IBKR Paper Trading Account
Invitation, you're "joining" the competition as a "client" associated with our
educator-level account. This is why **you must use the paper trader invitation
link that we send you** when you create your account -- if you don't, then the
Competition won't have visibility into your trading activity to use for scoring!

If you do have other accounts with IBKR -- either live or paper -- it's
important that you keep track of which account is which by **carefully recording
your account IDs, usernames, and passwords**.

**Always be sure to find your tradername on the [Registry](Registry.html) and
check to make sure the account you *think* we're using is the one we've
associated with your tradername.**

## Rolling Signup, Sponsored Competitions, and Eligibility
You can sign up in the Competition's system and create a paper trader at any
time. However, from time to time a **sponsored competition** is announced when
one or more generous sponsors choose to contribute towards prizes!

At the time of this writing, for example, [FinVC](finvc.co), (a venture capital
firm), [Horizen](horizen.io) (a crypto tech firm), and [Mesh](mesh.xyz) (an
incubator/R&D + investment firm) have graciously agreed to fund prizes for the
second annual **Spring Trading Competition**-- which will continue to grow and
blossom in the coming years.

To be eligible for the **2022 Spring Trading Competition** you must have signed
up and set up your paper trader by the deadline, which was **25 Jan 2022**.
HOWEVER, if you missed that deadline you can still sign up, practice trading,
and be ready for the next competition -- which we hope will be soon!

## Pruning Old Accounts
#### Bottom line: Trade once per month to keep your account active.
As time goes on, students will gravitate away from this Competition. They'll
graduate, drop out of school to create a massive tech empire, or maybe just lose
interest in paper trading because of all the returns they're raking in from
their Live accounts. 

This is fine and natural, but in order to avoid carrying an ever-increasing
number of defunct accounts, **we'll delete any account in which no trading
activity has taken place over the last 30 trading days**. This rule is enforced
as follows:

If your account falls into inactivity for a 25 consecutive trading day period,
you'll receive an email notice that you're slated for deletion in 5 trading
days. You'll need to log in to your account and make a trade to avoid deletion.
**ANY trade, no matter how small, will satisfy this requirement**.


## Instructions
Follow the instructions below to sign up.

### Step 0: Eligibility
You must be a currently enrolled graduate or undergraduate student with a
'.edu' email address.

### Step 1: Sign up
Fill out this form and click SUBMIT:
<div id="wufoo-div" style="background-color:#fff;border-style:ridge;">
<div id="wufoo-q7j67ol08e8luq" style => Fill out my <a href="https://dukefinance.wufoo.com/forms/q7j67ol08e8luq">online form</a>. </div> <script type="text/javascript"> var q7j67ol08e8luq; (function(d, t) { var s = d.createElement(t), options = { 'userName':'dukefinance', 'formHash':'q7j67ol08e8luq', 'autoResize':true, 'height':'866', 'async':true, 'host':'wufoo.com', 'header':'show', 'ssl':true }; s.src = ('https:' == d.location.protocol ?'https://':'http://') + 'secure.wufoo.com/scripts/embed/form.js'; s.onload = s.onreadystatechange = function() { var rs = this.readyState; if (rs) if (rs != 'complete') if (rs != 'loaded') return; try { q7j67ol08e8luq = new WufooForm(); q7j67ol08e8luq.initialize(options); q7j67ol08e8luq.display(); } catch (e) { } }; var scr = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0], par = scr.parentNode; par.insertBefore(s, scr); })(document, 'script'); </script></div>
    
### Step 2: Join the official Competition Slack Channel 
Within one business day of completing **Step 1**, you will receive an automatic
email welcoming you to the Competition and providing you a link to join the
official Competition Slack channel. **Follow the link and join the channel --
you should use your tradername as your Slack username here**. The Slack channel
is the means by which you can communicate with the Competition admin and the
other contestants. There, you can share strategies, meet new people, and ask any
questions you have about trading, the TWS platform, or any other technical
issues you might encounter. This channel is monitored by the Competition creator
and we strive to fix any technical issues that crop up as soon as possible.
    
### Step 3: Create your Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Paper Trader
Within one **business day** from the date on which you sign up, you'll receive
an invitation from Interactive Brokers (IBKR) to create the paper trading
account you'll be using for this competition. The subject of the invitation is
**Paper Trading Account Invitation**, and the invitation email is sent from
"**donotreply@interactivebrokers.com**".
     
* Use the link in your invitation email to sign up for a paper trader.
* You **must** sign up for a paper trader even if you already have another
account with IBKR.
* If you haven't received the email within one business day from the day on
which you signed up (check your spam folder!!!).
* If you **still** can't find your paper trader invitation, send a Direct
Message (DM) to **The Architect** using the Slack channel.
    
**BE CERTAIN TO RECORD YOUR ACCOUNT ID, USERNAME, AND PASSWORD**.

This information appears in a yellow box after you complete and submit your
paper trading account information and it's critical for your participation in
the Competition. Note that your IBKR username is not the same thing as the
tradername you chose when you registered. Your tradername is how you appear to
the world on this website when scoring and statistics are published, whereas the
IBKR username is the one you'll use when you sign in to your paper trader.

**If you run into a bunch of ????? when selecting your country**...
<center>![language error](language_error.png)</center>

...try changing the primary language to 'English' within your browser. DM The
Architect on Slack if you still have trouble.
    
### Step 4: Wait. 
It takes about **one business day** -- sometimes two or three -- for your paper
trading account to fully activate. Most of that time is due to obtaining your
permissions for market data subscriptions from the various market exchanges
around the world.

### Step 5: Explore 
Visit the [Getting Started](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/fintech-trading-competition.html) 
page. Install TWS and explore the Demo account for a bit while you wait for your
account to activate.

### Step 6: ACTIVATED!
You'll know your account is ACTIVE when you can log in to TWS with the
credentials you set up in **Step 3**. Sometimes there will be an awkward
**'limbo period'** during which you'll be able to log in to your PORTAL using a
browser, but you'll get an "**invalid username or password** error when you try
logging in to TWS:

<center> ![language error](limbo_error.png) </center>

If this happens, **don't try to reset your password yet**! This may only mean
that your account is **created**, but not yet **active**. You will probably be
able to log in to TWS on the next business day with no problem. If you still
can't log in after one business day, send a Slack DM to **The Architect**.

### Step 7: Check the [Registry](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html)
Confirm that the correct Account ID appears next to your tradername in the
[Registry](https://gothic-hedge-society.github.io/fintech.trading.competition/articles/registry.html)

### Step 8: Patience
As you wait for scoring to start, please be patent for a few days if there are
other traders still setting up their accounts!
